<h3> What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? </h3>

This picture should help us visualize what is going on.

First we have our content box. This is where all of our information goes. (e.g. text, img, etc). The content area is the main purpose of everything. let's compare it to a house to help explain what I mean. First you have the home. The home is filled with people, clothing, electronics, the lives of the people. This is the content, in other words the reason for the home is what goes inside. The important things are in the home, and that's our content. Oh let's add a dog in the home also, they would be the content.

Next we have the border. I need to talk about the border before we can get to padding. The border is what forms the home, the actual walls and the shape of the house deals with the border. In CSS the border does very much the same thing. You can change the thickness and shape of it. Its what borders the contents of the house.

Next we have the padding. In my illustration the padding is an empty space inside the home that can be used for decorating or making the contents look good. When you are in a house and look around there might be wallpaper, or more modern appraoch paint. There will also be things hanging and so forth. These are all there to make the content look better or in other words what's in the home. In css you can leave this blank but surround the conent so it's perfectly in the middle making it mmore appealing to the eye, just like an accent wall would do.

Last and definitely not least we have the margin. The margin is like the rest of the property outside of the home. It's the front yard, the backyard. the side yard, and any other lot associated with the home. This is the space that determines where your property starts and the other property begins. You can make this as big or as little as you want, but you have to remember that when the space is occupied by this invisible area then no other property can occupy it.
