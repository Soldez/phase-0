      The benefits of version control:


      <li>track all the changes that were done by multiple people on the same project</li>
      <li>able to restore a section of code if you think you messed up</li>
      <li>a place to store your work</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Git helps track changes by listing all of the modifications to the file as they are being saved. It keeps record of every change from the smallest period so there isn't a chancge that won't get tracked.    </p>

        You should use github to store your code so others can see it. The git community is a great place to see other codes and project that interest you and see how they did their code.
