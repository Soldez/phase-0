####How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
  
  You can use Chrome DevTools to see what is causing the current position and manipulate it there. It is very very useful and helps me to see how something is positioned then I work backwords to try to understand it better. overall i've learned how to reposition things in CSS by using devtools.

####How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can resize DOM using CSS by chaning the measurement of px (pixel) using a percentage (e.g. 50% would be 50% of the entire screen) or em (5em).
  

####What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

  Static positioning is the default property for html elements. Static positioned elements are not affected by top, bottom, left, or right.


  Absolute positioned behaves like fixed except it is not relative to the viewport but the nearest ancestor

  Fixed position elements are positioned relative to the web page so that it will always be on the viewers screen and will no matter if they scroll scrolls vertically or horizontally the element will remain. (e.g. if you fix an element to the right no matter if you scroll right or left top or down it will always be located on the right and move along with the scroll)

  Relative positioned means it's relative to their normal position, they can be maniupulated by using top, bottom, left, and right.

####What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
  
  Padding clears an area inside the box. 

  Borders go around padding and can be set to any color and thickness

  Margin clears an area outside of the border.

####What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
   
   This challenge help me to better understand positioning. For the longest time i didn't understand why I couldn't move something only to find out another box had a big margin that prevented another box from moving in the desired area. I like this challenge and it was fun pair programming.
