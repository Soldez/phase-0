				Shell is the way you interact with the computer on the command line and Bash is the language. So basically i’m interacting with you with Text (Shell) in the English (Bash) language. The most challenging part for me is everything haha. Just jumping into the command line was harder then expected. I’m very much in love with my track pad (or mouse) so this was like going back in time when those things didn’t exist. I was able to use all of the commands, was it successful? I’m not sure, but I did manage to memorize all of the commands. The most important ones in my mind, just because of use use, was ls, cd, and pwd.

<!--
1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

[Header / Footer / article / p / section /h1]
I see using section, article, p a lot. Being new to HTML using article and p seems like the main place where you put written content. Most of the internet is pages of written content so I imagine using these tags majority of the time.

2. How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The elements first start out with Html head and body (with closed tags respectively). The browser will display what is in the body tag in the order you inputted the content.


3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that Sublime has to potential to help a developer be efficient especially with snippets. I've tried making snippets but tend to end up typing it all out at the end.
