What is a wireframe?

Wire framing is like storyboarding for a movie or an app. It shows the flow of your webpage.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

The benefits I see is so that I can tell how the site looks like and the reaction to every action (or click) on the webpage. It's very helpful to be able to visually see which pages leads to where and how everything looks.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Yes, I enjoyed looking at websites and examples and making one that I feel will help the site.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I didn't start to do it until I found something I liked. 

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I used the resource "Giffy" that a fellow Bobolink told me about (Ian). It was very helpful.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed looking for ideas and implementing it and the tedious part is when I constantly push to github and check it even when i'm not completely finished...but that's my own issue and nothing about the work.
