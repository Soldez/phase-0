What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal will be to share my professional background and to learn more about my interests. The content will include my picture, contact information, work history, and current as well as future projects.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience's interest would be people who were in the same industry I was in and how they can start a new career in tech (yes, it's possible! =) )

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action I would want them to do would be to read about my journey switching careers and then contact me.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

It's not a one size fits all but if you're design and site looks organized and easy to find things that's what's important. 

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

UX is valuable because it can entice people to keep coming back to your page or in general terms, let's say desktop software, it helps the user like what they're doing.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I didn't find anything too tedious because it's all still new to me. Until I actually get the work and don't need an outside reference or cheat sheet it's still pretty new.
