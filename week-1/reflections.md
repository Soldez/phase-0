# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

The time management and productivity idea i learned about was in the “Habits & Growth Mindset”article. i was able to really reflect on the confidence part of it in the former part of the article. I tend to lack the confidence needed to jump into computer related things because of my lack of knowledge about it. This helped me to see to start small and build off of that. 
	Time Boxing is having a set period of time to do a planned activity and it can be used in Phase 0 as a way to better manage time and work. Currently I do not do time boxing and I see that when I don’t it’s easy to push homework of to the side and not have it as a priority. This week has been extremely busy and I see that happening so this is something I must change. I’m thinking of blocking off time in the morning and evening to get work done. My current strategy is not working as well as i’d hope and will change to a more structured time box.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

Shell is the way you interact with the computer on the command line and Bash is the language. So basically i’m interacting with you with Text (Shell) in the English (Bash) language. The most challenging part for me is everything haha. Just jumping into the command line was harder then expected. I’m very much in love with my track pad (or mouse) so this was like going back in time when those things didn’t exist. I was able to use all of the commands, was it successful? I’m not sure, but I did manage to memorize all of the commands. The most important ones in my mind, just because of use use, was ls, cd, and pwd.

 

pwd: print working directory (display current directory)

ls: list directories

mv: used to move files

cd: used to change directories

../: to go up...i think

touch: making an empty file like a word document

mkdir: makes a directory

less: you can use this to display text files

rmdir: remove directory

rm: removes a file

help: displays commands and information about them

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Create a Repo

step 1: Go to your Github homepage

step 2: In the top right corner click the ‘+’ sign and create new repository

 

Fork a Repo

step 1: click on a repo you want to fork

step 2: on the top right side there will be a fork (looks like a wishbone or a capital Y) click it

step 3: choose which of your repositories you’d like to fork it to

 

Clone a Repo

step 1: click on the repository you would like to clone

step 2: copy the link on the right hand side under “HTTPS clone URL” (there is a clipboard you can click to copy instantly”

step 3: go into your terminal and enter ‘git clone (paste what you copied from github here) and press enter

 

 I think I struggled with just setting everything up and understanding that my terminal is linked directly to github. I learned how to create, fork, and clone a repository on my github page.
