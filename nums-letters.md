### What does puts do?

puts prints out the output to the console with a new line.

for example when you "puts 2+1" the input is 2+1 and the output would be the sum of 2+1 and it would return 3 on a new line.


### What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are whole numbers and can be both negative and positive. (e.g. 4, 7, -19)
Floats are numbers that have a decimal point in it. (e.g. 1.1, 2.3, 6.7)


### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division will output only whole numbers and floats will output numbers with a decimal point. The main difference is that if you were to divide 7.0 by 2.0 with a float you would get 3.5 but if you divided that same number by an integer 7/2 you would just get 3. Integers will round down to the nearest whole number and is used for things you are unable to split.

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> puts 24*365
8760
=> nil
irb(main):002:0> 60*24*365*10
=> 5256000
irb(main):003:0>
```

### How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Like a calculator.

### What is the difference between integers and floats?

An Integer is a whole number and a float has a decimal point.


### What is the difference between integer and float division?

An integer will give you the whole number and round down when its needed.
A float will give you the number with a decimal point so it would be more precise on it's calculation.


### What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are a sequence of characters with quotes around it. They are used for calling back information at a given time without having to type all characters again if it's attached to a variable. This makes work easier and more efficient.


### What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are variables assigned within a method and you would use them so you can use other variables in other methods with the same variable name.


### How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

I liked this challenge a lot. It reminded me of why I wanted to get into coding in the first place. It brought back the things I learned when I was studying for the interview questions to get into DBC.
