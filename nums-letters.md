### What does puts do?

puts prints out the output to the console with a new line.

for example when you "puts 2+1" the input is 2+1 and the output would be the sum of 2+1 and it would return 3 on a new line.


### What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are whole numbers and can be both negative and positive. (e.g. 4, 7, -19)
Floats are numbers that have a decimal point in it. (e.g. 1.1, 2.3, 6.7)


### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?


```ruby
irb(main):001:0> puts 24*365
8760
=> nil
irb(main):002:0> 60*24*365*10
=> 5256000
irb(main):003:0>
```
